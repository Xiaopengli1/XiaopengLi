This article is a task of spatiotemporal Probabilistic Prediction for wind power. We using bayesian LSTM model by minimize the loss of KL-divergence and MSE loss, and  
taking into account the geographical distribution of wind farmsï¼Œ we introduce spatial correction of models to improve the accuracy.
