I am now a first-year Ph.D. student from the School of Data Science at the City University of Hong Kong, supervised by [Prof.Xiangyu Zhao](https://zhaoxyai.github.io/) in AML Lab. Before that, I got M.S. and B.Eng degrees from Xi'an Jiaotong University in 2022 and 2019. 

My research interests focus on Recommendation Systems and Information Retrieval.

For more information, please feel free to contact me.
