I am currently a postgraduate Student in Xi'an Jiaotong University (XJTU), working with [Prof.Zhanbo Xu](http://automation.xjtu.edu.cn/info/1048/1135.htm)  and [Prof.Jiang Wu](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/web/jiangwu/home). Before that, I obtained  B.Eng degree in  the same university in 2019, working with [Prof.Yunjia Li](http://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/web/liyunjia).

My research interests focus on CPS(Cyber Physicial System) and artificial intelligence, specifically on the topic of application of spatiotemporal network model in smart grid and smart building.

I have a lot of internship experience and scientific research experience, ready to join Alibaba Cloud Group as an algorithm engineer in July. However, becasue of academic pursuit, I am still looking for a PhD admissions opportunity, I expect  to enroll in 2022  fall or 2023 spring.
