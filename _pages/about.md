I am now a first-year Ph.D student from the School of Data Science at City University of Hong Kong, supervised by [Prof.Xiangyu Zhao](https://zhaoxyai.github.io/) in AML Lab. Before that, I got M.S. and B.Eng degree from Xian Jiaotong university in 2022 and 2019. 

My research interests focus on recommendation system ,spatiotemporal network model in smart grid and smart building.
