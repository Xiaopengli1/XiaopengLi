I am currently a Ph.D. student at the City University of Hong Kong, supervised by [Prof.Xiangyu Zhao](https://zhaoxyai.github.io/) in [AML Lab](https://aml-cityu.github.io/). Before that, I received M.S. and B.Eng degrees from Xi'an Jiaotong University in 2022 and 2019. 

My recent research interests include: 1) LLMs for Information Retrieval; 2) LLMs for Recommender System;
