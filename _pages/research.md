## Spatiotemporal Graph Attention Network(STGAT)

The spatiotemporal Graph Attention Network (STGAT) model captures spatial correlations among different stations and temporal dependencies of time series. The STGAT model employs a single layer GAT network to extract spatial correlations among stations and temporal dependencies are captured by the GRU model with a acurate prediction. This model was used in Wind Power prediction and Multi-zone indoor temperature prediction.
